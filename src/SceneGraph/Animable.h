/**
@brief %Animable

Adds animation feature to object. Each %Animable is part of some AnimableGroup,
which takes care of running the animations.

@section Animable-usage Usage

First thing is add Animable feature to some object and implement
animationStep(). You can do it conveniently using multiple inheritance (see
@ref scenegraph-features for introduction). Override animationStep() to
implement your animation, the function provides both absolute animation
time and time delta. Example:
@code
typedef SceneGraph::Object<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D<>> Object3D;
typedef SceneGraph::Scene<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D<>> Scene3D;

class AnimableObject: public Object3D, SceneGraph::Animable3D<> {
    public:
        AnimableObject(Object* parent = nullptr, SceneGraph::DrawableGroup3D<>* group = nullptr): Object3D(parent), SceneGraph::Animable3D<>(this, group) {
            setDuration(10.0f);
            // ...
        }

        void animationStep(Float time, Float delta) override {
            rotateX(15.0_degf*delta); // rotate at 15 degrees per second
        }
}
@endcode

Then add the object to your scene and some animation group. You can also use
AnimableGroup::add() and AnimableGroup::remove() instead of passing the group
in the constructor. The animation is initially in stopped state and without
repeat, see setState(), setRepeated() and setRepeatCount() for more information.
@code
Scene3D scene;
SceneGraph::AnimableGroup3D<> animables;

(new AnimableObject(&scene, &animables))
    ->setState(SceneGraph::AnimationState::Running);
// ...
@endcode

Animation step is performed by calling AnimableGroup::step() in your draw event
implementation. The function expects absolute time from relative to some fixed
point in the past and time delta (i.e. duration of the frame). You can use
Timeline for that, see its documentation for more information.
@code
Timeline timeline;
timeline.start();

void MyApplication::drawEvent() {
    animables.step(timeline.lastFrameTime(), timeline.lastFrameDuration());

    // ...

    timeline.nextFrame();
}
@endcode

@section Animable-performance Using animable groups to improve performance

AnimableGroup is optimized for case when no animation is running - it just
puts itself to rest and waits until some animation changes its state to
@ref AnimationState "AnimationState::Running" again. If you put animations
which are not pernamently running to separate group, they will not be always
traversed when calling AnimableGroup::step(), saving precious frame time.

@section Animable-explicit-specializations Explicit template specializations

The following specialization are explicitly compiled into %SceneGraph library.
For other specializations (e.g. using Double type) you have to use
Animable.hpp implementation file to avoid linker errors. See also
@ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.

 - @ref Animable "Animable<2, Float>", @ref AnimableGroup "AnimableGroup<2, Float>"
 - @ref Animable "Animable<3, Float>", @ref AnimableGroup "AnimableGroup<3, Float>"
