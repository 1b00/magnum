/**
@brief Base for object features

Contained in Object, takes care of transformation caching. See @ref scenegraph
for introduction.

Uses Corrade::Containers::LinkedList for accessing holder object and sibling
features.

@section AbstractFeature-subclassing Subclassing

Feature is templated on dimension count and underlying transformation type, so
it can be used only on object having transformation with the same dimension
count and type.

@subsection AbstractFeature-subclassing-caching Caching transformations in features

Features can cache absolute transformation of the object instead of computing
it from scratch every time to achieve better performance. See
@ref scenegraph-caching for introduction.

In order to have caching, you must enable it first, because by default the
caching is disabled. You can enable it using setCachedTransformations() and
then implement corresponding cleaning function(s) -- either clean(),
cleanInverted() or both. Example:
@code
class CachingFeature: public SceneGraph::AbstractFeature3D<> {
    public:
        CachingFeature(SceneGraph::AbstractObject3D<>* object): SceneGraph::AbstractFeature3D<>(object) {
            setCachedTransformations(CachedTransformation::Absolute);
        }

    protected:
        void clean(const Matrix4& absoluteTransformationMatrix) override {
            absolutePosition = absoluteTransformationMatrix.translation();
        }

    private:
        Vector3 absolutePosition;
};
@endcode

Before using the cached value explicitly request object cleaning by calling
`object()->setClean()`.

@subsection AbstractFeature-subclassing-transformation Accessing object transformation

Features has by default access only to AbstractObject, which is base of Object
not depending on any particular transformation implementation. This has the
advantage that features doesn't have to be implemented for all possible
transformation implementations, thus preventing code duplication. However it
is impossible to transform the object using only pointer to AbstractObject.

The transformations have interfaces for common functionality, so the feature
can use that interface instead of being specialized for all relevant
transformation implementations. Using small trick we are able to get pointer
to both AbstractObject and needed transformation from one constructor
parameter:
@code
class TransformingFeature: public SceneGraph::AbstractFeature3D<> {
    public:
        template<class T> TransformingFeature(SceneGraph::Object<T>* object):
            SceneGraph::AbstractFeature3D<>(object), transformation(object) {}

    private:
        SceneGraph::AbstractTranslationRotation3D<>* transformation;
};
@endcode
If we take for example @ref Object "Object<MatrixTransformation3D<>>", it is
derived from @ref AbstractObject "AbstractObject3D<>" and
@ref MatrixTransformation3D "MatrixTransformation3D<>", which is derived from
@ref AbstractTranslationRotationScaling3D "AbstractTranslationRotationScaling3D<>",
which is derived from
@ref AbstractTranslationRotation3D "AbstractTranslationRotation3D<>",
which is automatically extracted from the pointer in our constructor.

@section AbstractFeature-explicit-specializations Explicit template specializations

The following specialization are explicitly compiled into %SceneGraph library.
For other specializations (e.g. using Double type) you have to use
AbstractFeature.hpp implementation file to avoid linker errors. See also
@ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.

 - @ref AbstractFeature "AbstractFeature<2, Float>"
 - @ref AbstractFeature "AbstractFeature<3, Float>"
