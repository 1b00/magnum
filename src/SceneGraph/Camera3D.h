/**
@brief Camera for three-dimensional scenes

See Drawable documentation for introduction. The camera by default displays
OpenGL unit cube `[(-1, -1, -1); (1, 1, 1)]` with orthographic projection and
doesn't do any aspect ratio correction. Common setup example:
@code
SceneGraph::BasicCamera3D* camera = new SceneGraph::BasicCamera3D(&cameraObject);
camera->setPerspective({}, 0.001f, 100.0f)
      ->setAspectRatioPolicy(SceneGraph::AspectRatioPolicy::Extend);
@endcode

@section Camera3D-explicit-specializations Explicit template specializations

The following specialization are explicitly compiled into SceneGraph library.
For other specializations (e.g. using Double type) you have to use
BasicCamera3D.hpp implementation file to avoid linker errors. See
@ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.

 - @ref BasicCamera3D "BasicCamera3D<Float>"
