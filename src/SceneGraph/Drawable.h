/**
@brief %Drawable

Adds drawing function to the object. Each Drawable is part of some DrawableGroup
and the whole group is drawn with particular camera using AbstractCamera::draw().

@section Drawable-usage Usage

First thing is add Drawable feature to some object and implement draw(). You
can do it conveniently using multiple inheritance (see @ref scenegraph-features
for introduction). Example:
@code
typedef SceneGraph::Object<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D> Object3D;
typedef SceneGraph::Scene<SceneGraph::MatrixTransformation3D> Scene3D;

class DrawableObject: public Object3D, SceneGraph::Drawable3D {
    public:
        DrawableObject(Object* parent = nullptr, SceneGraph::DrawableGroup3D* group = nullptr): Object3D(parent), SceneGraph::Drawable3D(this, group) {
            // ...
        }

        void draw(const Matrix4& transformationMatrix, AbstractCamera3D* camera) override {
            // ...
        }
}
@endcode

Then you add these objects to your scene and some drawable group and transform
them as you like. You can also use BasicDrawableGroup::add() and
BasicDrawableGroup::remove().
@code
Scene3D scene;
SceneGraph::DrawableGroup3D drawables;

(new DrawableObject(&scene, &drawables))
    ->translate(Vector3::yAxis(-0.3f))
    ->rotateX(30.0_degf);
(new AnotherDrawableObject(&scene, &drawables))
    ->translate(Vector3::zAxis(0.5f));
// ...
@endcode

The last thing you need is Camera attached to some object (thus using its
transformation) and with it you can perform drawing in your draw event
implementation. See Camera2D and Camera3D documentation for more information.
@code
Camera3D<> camera(&cameraObject);

void MyApplication::drawEvent() {
    camera.draw(drawables);

    swapBuffers();
    // ...
}
@endcode

@section Drawable-performance Using drawable groups to improve performance

You can organize your drawables to multiple groups to minimize OpenGL state
changes - for example put all objects using the same shader, the same light
setup etc into one group, then put all transparent into another and set common
parameters once for whole group instead of setting them again in each draw()
implementation. Example:
@code
Shaders::PhongShader* shader;
SceneGraph::DrawableGroup3D phongObjects, transparentObjects;

void MyApplication::drawEvent() {
    shader->setProjectionMatrix(camera->projectionMatrix())
          ->setLightPosition(lightPosition)
          ->setLightColor(lightColor)
          ->setAmbientColor(ambientColor);
    camera.draw(phongObjects);

    Renderer::setFeature(Renderer::Feature::Blending, true);
    camera.draw(transparentObjects);
    Renderer::setFeature(Renderer::Feature::Blending, false);

    // ...
}
@endcode
