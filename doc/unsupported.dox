/** @page unsupported Unsupported OpenGL features

Some functionality, which is either soon-to-be deprecated or isn't proven to
add any performance gains, is not supported in %Magnum.

@section unsupported-features Unsupported features

- Luminance texture formats (OpenGL ES) are not supported, as they are
  deprecated in OpenGL ES 3.0 and not present in core desktop OpenGL.
- Fixed precision data types (OpenGL ES) are not supported, as they occupy the
  same memory as floats and they aren't faster than floats on current hardware
  anymore.

@section unsupported-extensions Unsupported extensions

- @extension{INTEL,map_texture} negatively affects texture access performance.
  Combination of buffer mapping and pixel buffers might be of the same or
  better performance, without affecting texture access speed.
- @extension{NV,draw_texture} can be done with framebuffer blitting and
  doesn't make any full-screen postprocessing easier, as shaders are excluded.
