/** @page building Downloading and building
@brief Guide how to download and build %Magnum on different platforms.

%Magnum can be downloaded from GitHub and built either
@ref building-compilation "manually" or using already prepared packaging files,
currently only @ref building-arch "ArchLinux PKGBUILDs". Guide how to
crosscompile for @ref building-win "Windows" and
@ref building-nacl "Google Chrome Native Client" is also available.

@tableofcontents

Minimal set of tools and libraries required for building is:

- C++ compiler with good C++11 support. Currently there are two compilers
  which are tested to support everything needed: **GCC** >= 4.6 and **Clang**
  >= 3.1.
- **CMake** >= 2.8.8 (needed for `OBJECT` library target)
- **GLEW** - OpenGL extension wrangler (only if targeting desktop OpenGL)
- **Corrade** - Plugin management and utility library. See
  @ref building-corrade "Corrade download and installation guide" for more
  information.

@section building-download Downloading the sources

The source is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mosra/magnum. Clone the
repository with your favorite IDE or Git GUI, download currrent snapshot as
compressed archive or use the command line:

    git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum.git

If you need toolchains for crosscompiling, run also the following commands, or,
if you build from source archive, download snapshot of toolchains repository
from https://github.com/mosra/toolchains and put them in `toolchains/`
subdirectory.

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

@section building-compilation Compilation, installation

The library (for example with support for GLUT applications) can be built and
installed using these four commands. See below for more information about
optional features.

    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
        -DWITH_GLUTAPPLICATION=ON
    make
    make install

If you want to build with another compiler (e.g. Clang), pass
`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++` to CMake.

@subsection building-optional Enabling or disabling features

By default the engine is built for desktop OpenGL. If you want to target
OpenGL ES, set `TARGET_GLES` to `ON` or pass `-DTARGET_GLES=ON` to CMake. Note
that some features are available for desktop OpenGL only, see @ref requires-gl.

By default the engine is built with everything except
@ref Platform "application libraries". Using `WITH_*` CMake parameters you can
specify which parts will be built and which not:

 - `WITH_EVERYTHING` - Defaults to `ON`, builds everything except window
   contexts. If set to `OFF`, only the main library is built and you can
   select additional libraries with the following:
 - `WITH_MESHTOOLS` - MeshTools library.
 - `WITH_PHYSICS` - Physics library.
 - `WITH_PRIMITIVES` - Primitives library.
 - `WITH_SCENEGRAPH` - SceneGraph library.
 - `WITH_SHADERS` - Shaders library.

None of the application libraries is built by default, regardless to
`WITH_EVERYTHING` is enabled or not:

 - `WITH_XEGLAPPLICATION` - X/EGL application, available only if targeting
   OpenGL ES (see above). Requires **X11** and **EGL** libraries.
 - `WITH_GLXAPPLICATION` - GLX application. Requires **X11** and **GLX**
   libraries.
 - `WITH_GLUTAPPLICATION` - GLUT application, available only if targeting
   desktop OpenGL. Requires **GLUT** library.
 - `WITH_SDL2APPLICATION` - SDL2 application. Requires **SDL2** library.

@subsection building-tests Building and running unit tests

If you want to build also unit tests (which are not built by default), pass
`-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` to CMake. Unit tests use Corrade's @ref Corrade::TestSuite
"TestSuite" framework and can be run using

    ctest --output-on-failure

in build directory. Everything should pass ;-)

@subsection building-doc Building documentation

The documentation (which you are currently reading) is written in **Doxygen**
(version 1.8 with Markdown support is used, but older versions should do good
job too) and additionally uses **Graphviz** for class diagrams and  **TeX**
for math formulas. The documentation can be build by running

    doxygen

in root directory (i.e. where `Doxyfile` is). Resulting HTML documentation
will be in `build/doc/` directory. You might need to create `build/` directory
if it doesn't exist yet.

@section building-arch Building ArchLinux packages

In `package/archlinux` directory is currently one PKGBUILD for Git development
build. The package is also in AUR under the same name.

There is also development PKGBUILD and MinGW development PKGBUILD in root,
which allows you to build and install the package directly from source tree
without downloading anything. The PKGBUILD also contains `check()` function
which will run all unit tests before packaging. Note that the unit tests
require Qt, as said above.

If you want to build with another compiler (e.g. Clang), run makepkg this way:

    CXX=clang++ makepkg

Both development PKGBUILDs can detect when Clang is used and remove
unsupported CXX flags.

@section building-win Crosscompiling for Windows using MinGW

@note This guide is tailored mainly for crosscompiling from ArchLinux. For
this system there is also prepared `mingw32-magnum` development package in
root, named `PKGBUILD-mingw32`.

You will need MinGW32 versions of the compiler and all libraries (GLEW,
Corrade), i.e. these ArchLinux packages:

- `mingw32-gcc`, which depends on `mingw32-w32api` containing OpenGL headers
- `mingw32-runtime`
- `mingw32-glew`
- `mingw32-corrade`

Make sure you have `toolchains` submodule updated, as
@ref building-download "explained above". Then create build directory and run
cmake and make. You may need to modify the `basic-mingw32.cmake` file and
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to suit your distribution filesystem hierarchy.

    mkdir build-win
    cd build-win
    cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchains/archlinux/basic-mingw32.cmake \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/i486-mingw32
    make

Then you can install the package using `make install` to make it available for
depending projects.

@section building-nacl Compiling for Google Chrome Native Client

You will need [Native Client SDK](https://developers.google.com/native-client/beta/sdk/download).
Tested version is `pepper_22`.

Make sure you have `toolchains` Git submodule updated, as
@ref building-download "explained above". Don't forget to adapt `NACL_PREFIX
variable in `generic/NaCl-glibc-x86-32.cmake` and `generic/NaCl-glibc-x86-64.cmake`
to path where your SDK is installed. Default is `/usr/nacl`.

Then create build directories for x86-32 and x86-64 and run cmake and make in
them. The toolchains needs access to its platform file, so be sure to properly
set **absolute** path to `modules/` directory containing `Platform/NaCl.cmake`.
Also adapt `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the same value you entered into toolchain
files above.

    mkdir -p build-nacl-x86-32
    cd build-nacl-x86-32
    cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH="/absolute/path/to/toolchains/modules" \
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../toolchains/generic/NaCl-glibc-x86-32.cmake" \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/nacl \
        -DWITH_NACLAPPLICATION=ON \
        -DLIB_SUFFIX=/32
    make

    mkdir -p build-nacl-x86-64
    cd build-nacl-x86-64
    cmake .. \
        -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH="/absolute/path/to/toolchains/modules" \
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../toolchains/generic/NaCl-glibc-x86-64.cmake" \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/nacl \
        -DWITH_NACLAPPLICATION=ON
    make

Then you can install both versions using `make install` to make them available
for depending projects. The headers are shared by both versions.

For ArchLinux there is also prepared package file in root, named
`PKGBUILD-nacl`.
